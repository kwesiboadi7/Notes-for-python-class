1. Variables: are containers that store values temporarily.
   
   Eg;  >>> cars = 'toyota', 'benz', 'ford'
	>>> print cars
	('toyota', 'benz', 'ford')
	
	so in the example above cars become the variable where it values are toyota, benz, ford.


2. Reserved words are words that can not be used as variables. Examples are listed below.

and, exec, not, assert, finally, or, break, for, pass, class, from, print, continue, global, raise, def, if, return, del, import, try, elif, in, while, else, is, with, except, lambda, yield


3. Types of values/data type
   
	There are five standard data types: numbers, strings, list, tuple and dictionary.

	Numbers: number data types store numeric values.

    Eg;	>>> age = 10, 15, 20
	>>> print age
	(10, 15, 20)
	
	Strings: strings in python are characters represented in the quotation marks. so in these 		case it can be text or number onces it appears in the quotation mark it is a string.

    Eg;	>>> regions = 'accra', 'ashanti', 'volta', 'northern'
	>>> print regions
	('accra', 'ashanti', 'volta', 'northern')

	Lists: a list contians items seperated by commas and enclosed within square brackets. 		       Lists are the most versatile of Python's compound data types.

    Eg;	>>> list = ['sugar', 'milo', 'coffee', 007, 419]
	>>> print list
	['sugar', 'milo', 'coffee', 7, 419]
	
	Tuples; A tuple is another sequence data type that is similar to the list. A tuple 		consists of a number of values separated by commas. Unlike lists, however, tuples are 		enclosed within parentheses. The main differences between lists and tuples are: Lists are 		enclosed in brackets ( [ ] ) and their elements and size can be changed, while tuples are 		enclosed in parentheses ( ( ) ) and cannot be updated. Tuples can be thought of as 
	read-only lists.

    Eg;	>>> tuple = ('abcd', 786, 2.23, 'Alex')
	>>> print tuple
	('abcd', 786, 2.23, 'Alex')
	
	Dictionary: A dictionary key can be almost any Python type, but are usually numbers or 		strings. Values, on the other hand, can be any arbitrary Python object.
	Dictionaries are enclosed by curly braces ({ }) and values can be assigned and accessed 	using square braces ([]).

    Eg;	




4. Operators:Operators are the constructs which can manipulate the value of operands.Consider the 		     expression 4 + 5 = 9. Here, 4 and 5 are called operands and + is called operator.

	Operator types; arithmetic, comparison, assignment, logical, bitwise, membership, identity 				operators.






   
raw input
 name = raw_input('what is my name')
what is my name Alexander>>> name = raw_input('what is my name')
what is my name Alexander
>>> name
' Alexander'

>>> time = raw_input('what time is it')
what time is it
>>> time = raw_input ('what time is it ?')
what time is it ?hello world time
>>> time[6]
'w'
del: is used to delete a variable
list is a group of informations seperated by comas
Print: collects an information you want to display and just outputs it.
